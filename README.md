### Implementation of Particle Swarm Optimization on Three-body problem 
1.Implemented PSO algorithm on a three-body system simulator with graphical user interface allowing users to input initial parameters  
2.Built a model in a 3D coordinate system to represent the position and movement for the three-body system    
3.Used Java 3D, PSO algorithm
