### Implementation of Particle Swarm Optimization on Three-body problem 
1.Implemented PSO algorithm on a three-body system simulator with graphical user interface allowing users to input initial parameters  
2.Built a model in a 3D coordinate system to represent the position and movement for the three-body system    
3.Used Java 3D, PSO algorithm

You can input the initial position, velocity, and mass for each body 
The left screen show the over all motion of three body  
The right screen show the motion of all particles. Every times before the body move, I release 15 particles for each bodies(totally 45 particle running at the same time) to find the best position
